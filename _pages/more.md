# Welcome to the NCMG

## Supporting Complaints Managers Across England

The NCMG (National Complaints Managers' Group) aims to provide vital support to complaints managers, who often face isolated and challenging roles. We achieve this through:

- **Facilitating Peer Support:** We offer regional and national networks to connect complaints managers, fostering peer support and collaboration.

- **Sharing Information and Best Practices:** We share valuable information, ideas, advice, and experiences to enhance best practices in complaint management.

- **Representing Your Views:** Acting as a conduit, we gather and represent the views and experiences of complaints managers during policy and regulation reviews. This ensures that practice development is informed by collective knowledge and learning.
